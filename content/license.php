				<h1>Information about the CompactCMS license</h1>
				<p>Thank you for your interest in possible licensing options for CompactCMS. Below you'll find a short description of the current licensing policy for CompactCMS. For users who rely on my content management system for their own business there are additional options which are explained further down.</p>
<p><em>Note that you are <strong>not</strong> allowed at any time to modify and/or remove the original CompactCMS logo's, copyright info and any other references. Code modification and redistribution is allowed, when keeping in tact all references to the CompactCMS website.</em></p>
<div class="span-14">
<h3>Options for commercial users</h3>
<p>It is not allowed to remove any of the branding, which includes the CompactCMS logo, the "W" icon and/or any copyright tags and references, from the CompactCMS administration. Those users who would like to brand the CompactCMS application with their own logo and company name should <a href="http://www.compactcms.nl/contact.html">contact me</a> to discuss the possibilities and pricing features.</p>
<h3>Donation â‰  license</h3>
For those who rely on my script for their own business, or for those who have found CompactCMS useful in maintaining their website, there is - 
of course - always an option to make any form of <a href="http://www.compactcms.nl/donate.html">contribution</a>.
<p>By making a donation you acknowledge you've found the application useful and that it has helped you and your business. A donation can take many forms and does not have to be monetary (e.g. a personal postal card from your area). What a donation does not do is give you any development privileges (e.g. the addition of non-relevant features or unique color scheming).</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to drop me a line <a title="Send me an e-mail using the contact form" href="http://www.compactcms.nl/contact.html">by e-mail</a> or at <a title="Visit the forum" href="http://community.compactcms.nl/forum/">the forum</a>.</p>
