How to install on Ubuntu
========================

When you have a minimal Ubuntu install, e.g. when running Ubuntu Server on a
VPS machine, then you should make sure all repositories are accessible by
apt-get et al by running:

    ./setup_aptget_sourceslist.sh

which will install an extra sources.list file in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
directory and update the dictionary accordingly.

In all circumstances, you should execute the

    ./install_vps_everything.sh

script to install all the basics on any Ubuntu system, including apache and
PHP.

Note that the script can prompt for a few passwords near the end (when
installing mySQL) which you must provide manually; hence this install is
not entirely automatic, alas.

Next you can go and install CCMS manualy or fetch the latest code from
github by running this script:

    ./install_site_from_github_code.sh

NOTE that this script will fetch a development revision at or near the current
bleading edge so your mileage will vary, depending on when you run this.
When you want to play it safe, fetch a release archive for CCMS and follow
the install instructions for that one!
