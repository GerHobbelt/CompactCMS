/*
Only IE7 shows a horizon scrollbar @ 1024x768 displays due to miscalculating the pageWrapper/.container-25 div set.

Here we tweak the margin to make that useless scrollbar disappear at that resolution.

We only nibble 1px off the right side to keep the (useful!) vertical scrollbar from looking damaged.

Tested on a Dutch XP SP3 Win32 + KB's installed up to Nov/2010, default setup, + IE7 installed, otherwise empty.

/*
If you do not FORCE the outer <div> in the template ditor to hasLayout, then IE7/IE6[*]
GOES ABSOLUTELY HONKIN' TOOTIN' MENTAL placing the edit_Area control in there: it keeps 
blinking the dreaded hourglass and you're ab-so-lu-te-ly SOL because you don't get to see, 
not edit the contents in the <textarea>. Instead, you get the '|' text cursor placed 
somewhere near the top of your screen.

I !@#$%^&* hate MSIE!
																	Ger Hobbelt
																	
This took quite a while to find out, because I hadn't expected the outer div to cause this
problem (my agony over the backup management page yesterday should've taught me a lesson, 
but no-o-o-o-o-o-o-o...); what made 'everything work' was pasting the original edit_Area
example code in there; after that it was a matter of slowly stripping away JS and HTML 
until we got to 'the edge', which turned out to be a lone <h2> at the top. A-fuckin'-ha!																	

[*] generally, it would be IE6 going mental most of the time, but I've had occasions
    during this trial where IE6 did fine while IE7 took over wrecking the joint. So the
	hasLayout hack is magnimoniously delivered to the both of 'em.
